                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Google's Flutter toolkit was a toolkit that allows developers to
                        build native apps on Android and iOS from a single code-base.
                        It is a cross-platform framework that allows developers to
                        build an app once and deploy it to both the iOS and Android
                        platforms. Project Hummingbird is Google taking Flutter to the
                        web development space.

                    <li>
                        Initially, Flutter, when it was first released a couple months ago,
                        was meant solely for mobile app development, but now it has expanded
                        to include web development as well with its new web-based development tooling.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The current version/release of Flutter (at the time of this writing)
                        is version 1.2, which includes support for Android app bundles, the latest
                        Dart2.2 SDK (all Flutter apps are written in Google's programming language Dart),
                        and web-friendly functionality like new keyboard events and mouse hover support.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>Implications</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This is definitely a power move on Google's end into the cross-platform
                        software development market. One of the biggest struggles of software development,
                        especially mobile and web development, is the rapid updates and arrivals of
                        development tools, programming languages, frameworks, etc. Google is now
                        responding to that by allowing developers to build for three platforms (Android,
                        iOS, and web) with one developer tool.

                        This could be Google's answer/competition to Facebook's React series. For web
                        development, Facebook maintains its ReactJS framework and for mobile app
                        development, Facebook maintains its React Native framework. Both the ReactJS and
                        React Native frameworks are linked and the skills to use either one is transferrable
                        to the other. From this, it is clear that Facebook already has a strong stake in
                        the cross-platform development sector, and Google is aiming to extend its reach in
                        this sector as well by creating and maintaining Flutter, which combines mobile and
                        web development into one developer toolkit (Flutter).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Given that two large tech companies, Google and Facebook, have set their stakes
                        in the cross-platform development sector, it can be inferred that the software
                        development process will become much faster. It is easier to get the ball
                        rolling, since new developers can learn to use less development tools to get
                        their jobs done, and can deploy their work to more platforms and reach a much
                        wider audience. The drive put forth by Google toward cross-platform development
                        is a sign that software development and deployment will become much more
                        simple and faster, an undeniable boost in efficiency.
