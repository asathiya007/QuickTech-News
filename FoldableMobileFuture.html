                <ul>
                    <li>
                        In the ever so quickly growing market of mobile devices, such as
                        smartphones, tablets, etc. comes a new revolution in design: foldability.
                        Foldables are are mobile devices that, exactly as the name implies, can
                        be folded. One of the biggest companies to display their design of a foldable
                        mobile device is Samsung.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Samsung revealed a prototype of the Galaxy Fold, Samsung's new foldable
                        mobile device, at one of their recent developer conferences. The big reveal of
                        the prototype first showed off its foldable design, which appeared much
                        smoother and resembled non-foldable devices to a much greater than degree than
                        other foldable device prototypes, which clearly marks progress in the design
                        and development of foldable mobile devices, not just by Samsung, but by the tech
                        industry as a whole. The Galaxy Fold is set to launch on April 26.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Other notable features of the Galaxy Fold prototype include but are not limited to
                        the remarkable amount of storage for a mobile device (12 GB RAM, 512 GB of storage)
                        six cameras, and a size change from 4.6 inches (folded) to 7.3 inches (unfolded).
                        The Galaxy Fold was built to provide an exceptional amount of functionality and
                        capability to the user and their various needs, whether it be work, entertainment,
                        design, etc.

                <h3>Implications</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        This may signal the start of a new trend: foldable mobile devices. For years and years,
                        people have sought smaller devices but bigger screens. This just may be the perfect
                        solution to such a desire. The foldability of the Galaxy Fold and other foldable
                        devices allows it to be compact when stored in one's pocket as well as large when
                        expanded for either professional or entertainment use.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This is officially Samsung's stride into the foldable mobile device market.
                        The prospects of foldable mobile devices has been questioned ever since the
                        concept of a folding mobile device was thought of. The entry of a large
                        firm in the tech industry, Samsung, will most likely spur other large companies,
                        such as Apple, Huawei, etc. to start building their own foldable mobile devices.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This may be the next step of a phenomenon I like to call design convergence:
                        when the functionality of multiple devices is combined into one. One such example
                        of this is with today's smartphones, which combine the functionality (to some extent)
                        of a game console (mobile gaming), the telephone (calling people), and music players
                        (to listen/play music). The advent of foldable mobile devices may present something
                        even more grand: a fusion between a smartphone and a laptop. For most people, their
                        laptops are work devices and their smartphones are play/entertainment devices, but
                        with foldable mobile devices, it is very possible that mobile devices can continue
                        to be the professional and entertainment devices they have been but now to a greater
                        degree, since a larger mobile device with more storage and computing power can likely
                        perform tasks that were initially reserved for computers. This marks a potential
                        change in lifestyle and productivity, since the roles of two very powerful devices,
                        are slowly and may one day fully converge toward one device: the foldable.
