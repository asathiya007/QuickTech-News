                    QuickTech Blogs was started by Akshay Sathiya in February 2019.
                    This project was inspired by Sathiya's noticing of himself and
                    many others' struggles to stay updated and in the loop with the
                    ever so quickly developing and growing tech industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Realizing this, Sathiya decided to build this website, which
                    would use his unique "three sets of three" approach on
                    important, current events in the tech industry. In three bullet points,
                    the event will be summarized. In three more bullet points, the implications
                    of the event will be stated. The last three bullet points will point the
                    reader to other sites/resources for them to read more, if they wish.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This approach will enable many more people to keep up with and
                    understand the tech industry to a much greater degree.
