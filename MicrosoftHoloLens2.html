                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Microsoft's HoloLens 2 is the Microsoft's newest mixed reality visor. It is the next
                        version/successor of Microsoft's HoloLens, which made its debut in 2015. When the
                        HoloLens was demoed back in 2015, many suspected that the demos had been faked
                        because the functionality, display, and the stand-alone nature of the device
                        had never been seen before. Now, Microsoft is back with another big step: the HoloLens 2.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Microsoft was not under a lot of pressure to design the produce the HoloLens 2, mainly
                        because of a lack of large-scale competitors. Thus, they had lots of time to work on the
                        HoloLens 2 and were allowed to move at such a pace to ensure quality of quanity or speed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The HoloLens 2 boasts a much higher level of quality compared to its predecessor, the HoloLens.
                        The hardware has improved with the times, the field of vision is much broader, it weighs a tad bit
                        less, and the device and its functionality are as a whole much faster and more user-friendly.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>Implications</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The fact that Microsoft took the time to create and deliver a second version of the
                        HoloLens is a sign that the fields of mixed reality (augmented and virtual reality)
                        are becoming more and more highly demanded, not just by normal consumers, but also
                        by businesses. For example, modeling and simulation in the mixed reality space allows for
                        a much greater level or organization and effectiveness. Taking into account other instances
                        and use cases for the mixed reality technologies, it is clear that Microsoft is taking steps
                        to pander to a growing consumer space.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Microsoft has no real competitors at the moment. One competitor is Magic Leap, which is
                        still a young and growing company. Being the only large firm in this space, Microsoft has
                        a considerable advantage is boosting the speed of the integration of its mixed reality
                        technology into modern business and enterprise. It also has a considerable amount of sway
                        in dictating the types of designs of mixed reality wear as well as the direction of the
                        mixed reality sector as a whole due to its position of power in the sector and its greater
                        access to consumers, businesses, and resources.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The HoloLens aims to mimic a full mixed reality display, where almost the entire
                        field of vision of the user is used for mixed reality displays. This is a special take
                        because the Google Glass, which only made use of the upper corner of the user's field of
                        vision, did not succeed as a product and for the most part has been discontinued. Meanwhile,
                        the Microsoft HoloLens line has a new and better addition, and seems to be running strong.
                        This is a clear indication of Microsoft attempting to attract consumers and potential
                        users with a full immersion in mixed reality technology, rather than patrial immersion, which
                        Google attempted to do with its Google Glass technology. Only time will tell if Microsoft's new
                        strategy in the mixed reality technology space will be successful.
