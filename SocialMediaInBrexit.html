                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Brexit is the event in which the United Kingdom/Great Britain decided
                        to leave the European Union, which followed the referendum of 23 June
                        2016 and which will officially start in March 29, 2019.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Many people believe that social media had a huge role in the development
                        and passing of Brexit. Those in favor of Brexit were supposedly higher
                        in both number and activity on social media than those who were in favor
                        of the UK/Great Britain remaining in the European Union. This greater
                        social media presence not only made the viewpoints and beliefs of those
                        in favor of Brexit louder in volume, but also farther in its span. Those
                        in favor of Brexit had much more influence over the voters in the middle
                        ground and were able to sway them to vote in support of Brexit.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The for-Brexit side of the election did a much better job than the against-Brexit
                        sie of the election when it came to using hashtags. By using three simple hashtags
                        (#Brexit, #Beleave and #VoteLeave) over and over in their posts, Brexit supporters
                        were able to connect with each other and also connect middle ground voters to
                        other Brexit supporters and pro-Brexit content. Ultimately, the for-Brexit side
                        of the election was able to amplify the Brexit support and spread it to the middle
                        ground voters in such a way that the against-Brexit side of the election was not
                        able to, which ultimately sealed the election and allowed Brexit to pass.

                <h3>Implications</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Hashtags are a powerful of connecting one's views and beliefs to other users who
                        share said views and beliefs and users who are in the middle ground and can be swayed
                        toward a certain political alignment given enough perceived support and content
                        pertaining to a certain political event.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In the very possible case that certain news outlets and/or sources
                        provide inaccurate or false information (intentionally or unintentionally),
                        this could falsely sway voters to vote on a political issue in a way that
                        they do not agree with or understand, which delegitimizes not only the
                        popular vote, but can also steer government in the wrong direction in
                        what it believes is best for its constituents.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Young people who are relatively new to politics and political involvement
                        can be made the targets of aggressive social media campaigns. Given that
                        young people are the most active generation on social media, this creates
                        a combined scenario in which the next generation of voters and politicians
                        can be easily and heavily swayed by current political groups and ideologies
                        when they are in a stage of their lives and careers where they are not as
                        experienced or knowledgeable as they should be in order to make the big
                        decisions that they need to. Ultimately, young people are more likely
                        to be targeted by the polar political groups and campaigns, and this is
                        a focus that social media companies such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.
                        should take into account when considering the experiences and impacts that
                        their respective platforms will have on their young users.
