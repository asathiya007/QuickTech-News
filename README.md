# QuickTech-News
This is the code for the website of a project of mine called QuickTech News, which aims to enable people to quickly get the gist of current events in the tech industry as well as enable them to read and learn more about said current events, should they choose to delve deeper. This is the ideal solution to the problems of news outlets' lack of brevity when writing news articles and people's lack of time when reading the news and staying in the loop with the current events of the tech industry.
